      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h2>Calculator</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/raylopez509/calc">GitHub</a>
      <p>
        A one line basic calculator written in Python. This project helped me
        get back into the mindset of programming
      </p>
      <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/raylopez509/tictactoe">GitHub</a>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <Link href="/tictactoe">Link</Link>
      <p>
        My very first project to self-learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS. A simple
        application that plays out Tic Tac Toe with an endgame state,
        highlighting squares of the winning move.
      </p>
      <h2>First Person Selector</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/raylopez509/randomizer">GitHub</a>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <Link href="/firstperson">Link</Link>
      <p>
        Another simple application that allows a user to input a list of names
        and the app chooses one person. To be used when needing to select a
        person to go first in a board game. This application combined with Tic
        Tac Toe got my feet wet in web development.
      </p>
      <h2>Team Randomizer</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/raylopez509/reactteamrandomizer">GitHub</a>
      <Link href="/teamrandomizer">Link</Link>
      <p>
        An expansion to the First Person Selector that takes an inputted list of
        names and puts them into a selected number of equal teams. Originally
        written in plain{" "}
        <a href="https://github.com/raylopez509/teamrandomizer">Javascript</a>,
        I wanted to expand on using popular frameworks, so I programmed this web
        app with React.js.
